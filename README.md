# Task 3: Text Generation with Markov Chains

## Overview
This project implements a simple text generation algorithm using Markov chains.  
The model learns the probability of a word based on the previous word(s) and generates new text that mimics the style of the training data.

## Features
- Supports n-gram Markov chains (default n=2)
- Generates text based on learned word transitions
- Easy to modify input text and n-gram size
- Simple Python implementation requiring no extra libraries

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aneezhassan/PRODIGY_GA_03.git
   cd PRODIGY_GA_03
Run the script or open the notebook in Google Colab.
Replace the sample text with your own input text or upload a .txt file.
Adjust the n-gram size if desired.
Run the code to generate text.
